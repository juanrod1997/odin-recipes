    <h2>Texas-style brisket is more than just food you eat, it's a slow, rewarding process that leaves you with the most delicious, juicy sliced beef you will ever have. This recipe implies you already have a smoker of any type and all the required accoutrement to run it.</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>10 pounds or more of beef brisket</li>
