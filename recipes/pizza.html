    <h2>This is a relatively quick pizza dough recipe I use when I'm craving a pizza, but don't want to go through the trouble of resting for extended periods of time.</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 package (1/4 oz) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp white sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups bread flour or 00 flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
