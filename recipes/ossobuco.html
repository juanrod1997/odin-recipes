    <h2>Ossobuco is a traditional Italian dish made by braising veal shanks in stock with wine and other ingredients, garnished with a gremolata made of fresh herbs, oil, and garlic. Ossobuco is normally served with polenta or risotto alla milanese.</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Ossobuco:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 - 1 pound veal shanks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>2/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2/3 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gremolata:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh flat lead parsley</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dust veal shanks lightly in flour</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add the veal, and cook until browned on the outside. Remove to a bowl, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add two cloves of crushed garlic and onion to the skillet; cook and stir until onion is tender.</li>
        <li>Return the veal to the pan and mix in the carrot and wine. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomatoes and beef stock, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cover, and simmer over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, basting the veal every 15 minutes or so. The meat should be tender, but not falling off the bone.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the parsley, 1 clove of garlic and lemon zest. Sprinkle the gremolata over the veal just before serving.</li>
